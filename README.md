# GaR coding exercise

This is what I'll be doing:

> At this week’s meeting, we devised an exercise to help us all train a bit on coding. We’ve determine to take a slice of a specific repo and have everyone go off and code it independently. Afterwards, we’ll come back together and see where we align and diverge. This will give us a clearer picture on how we’re viewing the repos and narrow our language down to build a codebook for our discourse analysis once we get our Atlas.ti license.

> After discussion, we honed in on Matt’s Purrrfect Pizza repo ([https://github.com/mouseandthebillionaire/purrrfectPizza](https://github.com/mouseandthebillionaire/purrrfectPizza "https://github.com/mouseandthebillionaire/purrrfectPizza")) and the specific week of September 19-25. This is not to say that you’re not allowed to look at or code anything outside of that week-long range—go and check out whatever you like that will give you more context! But we’re really interested in seeing what we each get when we check out that one week of commits. As you approach this slice of the repo, the overarching question to consider is **“What is this person’s design routine?”** It’s not a question we definitively expect to answer based on the slice, but we’re keen to see what people might detect or extrapolate. { emphasis is mine }

> For the next two weeks, we’ll be skipping regular meetings to focus on this coding exercise (and because Rilla’s out of town lol). But in the meantime, please drop questions about using Ponte in the ⁠`🔨-tool-talk` channel. Discussion of codes and coding can happen in the ⁠`🔎-practices-of-analysis` channel. And it may be helpful to do some co-working on this together in order to troubleshoot and discuss, so please let us know if you think we ought to organize a session for that at some point. Thank you so much for taking the time to read this really long message, and happy coding!

The exercise is mostly done, I just mostly need to add a concluding memo.
