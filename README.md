# GaR coding exercise

This is what I'll be doing:

> At this week‚Äôs meeting, we devised an exercise to help us all train a bit on coding. We‚Äôve determine to take a slice of a specific repo and have everyone go off and code it independently. Afterwards, we‚Äôll come back together and see where we align and diverge. This will give us a clearer picture on how we‚Äôre viewing the repos and narrow our language down to build a codebook for our discourse analysis once we get our Atlas.ti license.
>
> After discussion, we honed in on Matt‚Äôs Purrrfect Pizza repo ([https://github.com/mouseandthebillionaire/purrrfectPizza](https://github.com/mouseandthebillionaire/purrrfectPizza "https://github.com/mouseandthebillionaire/purrrfectPizza")) and the specific week of September 19-25. This is not to say that you‚Äôre not allowed to look at or code anything outside of that week-long range‚Äîgo and check out whatever you like that will give you more context! But we‚Äôre really interested in seeing what we each get when we check out that one week of commits. As you approach this slice of the repo, the overarching question to consider is **‚ÄúWhat is this person‚Äôs design routine?‚Äù** It‚Äôs not a question we definitively expect to answer based on the slice, but we‚Äôre keen to see what people might detect or extrapolate. { emphasis is mine }

> For the next two weeks, we‚Äôll be skipping regular meetings to focus on this coding exercise (and because Rilla‚Äôs out of town lol). But in the meantime, please drop questions about using Ponte in the ‚Å†`üî®-tool-talk` channel. Discussion of codes and coding can happen in the ‚Å†`üîé-practices-of-analysis` channel. And it may be helpful to do some co-working on this together in order to troubleshoot and discuss, so please let us know if you think we ought to organize a session for that at some point. Thank you so much for taking the time to read this really long message, and happy coding!

## How to read this

The journal of the coding sessions are on the `journals` folder, [starting here](<./journals/20240702-initial_notes.md>). They give a good sense of how coding progressed, and would be a good starting point. Memos are on the `memos` folder, and encompass different analysis, discussion of codes, and image annotations. The Ponte project files are on the `ponte_projects`  folder and can be loaded on Ponte 0.1.5 for use. As I went about coding, I also started keeping track of bugs and issues with the tool itself [in a separate file](<./Ponte bugs and wishlist.md>). Finally, I wrote a short [closing journal note](<./journals/20240724-closing_note.md>) to wrap the exercise and showing the last state of the codebook. 

An important reference in how I went about doing this is the Salda√±a book below, mentioned in a few of my journal entries:
