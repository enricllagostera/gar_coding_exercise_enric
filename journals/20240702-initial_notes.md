# 2024-07-02 Initial notes and coding session

## Thoughts on coding approach

So, after reading @saldana2009a and reflecting, I'm leaning towards a few decisions:

**Keep a wiki for coding process and memos.** That way I can both keep a log of how I'm approaching things and have a place for interlinked analytic memos.

Work with the following **coding approaches**: 1) On a **first pass**, *structural coding* [@saldana2009a, 68] around designer routine, then *process coding* [@saldana2009a, 77] to help pinpoint it, and descriptive coding (mostly in vivo when possible) to highlight salient features.	2) On a **second pass**, as a refinement, I'd focus on emotional codes (mostly values and evaluations) [@saldana2009a, 86]. For organizing and elaborating analysis, probably something like *pattern coding*. [@saldana2009a, 152]

A big thing to consider is that te material itself is kind of small, so it might be difficult to notice larger patterns or to get enough density for two passes.

## Starting actions and codings

Start of coding session: 12h30.

I loaded the repo and created a v0 save of the coding project, to speed things up later on. I started looking around the week under different time units in the timeline tool. Doing that, it became clearer that there are 4 work sessions or groups of commit that seem to form coherent groups and are separated by long blocks of time (+12h). They fit to a daily division of work.

As I created some structural codes for this, I realized a bug on the tool in which codes created manually via the tagging system are not being merged together, so each instance shows separately on the export summary as duplicates. Added it to the [Ponte bugs and wishlist](<../Ponte bugs and wishlist.md>) list.

OK, started looking at each commit. Noticed that the journaling is happening on `Process/README.md` so I created an auto-encoder for that. Decided to have a codebook overview down in this journal entry.

Another thing that caught my attention was how the timestamps and durations seem important to think about routine. All the **work session 2** commits together span a short period of time and what they refer to is similar to what appears on **work sessions 3 and 4**. I might need to regroup these: they might make more sense as a cohesive unit all together.

I'm finding myself using the "pin" button on the timeline navigation a lot to find my way bak to my area of focus. Also, as I coded more, I started using the switching pill between the export summary and the other views more. I feel I'd like to have a quick button for going to the export summary view also.

Also, autosaving would be nice in the tool.

I'm noticing a certain sequence of actions emerging in how I am coding this. I start by looking at the commit page on GitHub, as I can get an overview of all changes. This gives me a better idea of what were the materials involved in the commit. Then, I move on to adding process codes.

End of coding session: 16h00-ish. I think I'm close to a first pass on the focused commits. I have a few other actions I want to take before moving on to the second pass itself (memoing images, getting some more context). I feel I'll need those to enrich the codes a bit more, particularly on aspects that are less represented on the written journals and code itself.

I actually felt that looking at these stats did not help particularly so far.
### Playing first digital version

The result of my first playing of the build linked. However, this build kept being updated in later commits than the first one, so the version I played is not necessarily the same one that is being referenced in the commit. Actually playable version linked is from commit#2ef1995, so I encoded that using a #playable_prototype_build_v1_end code.

## Further memos

- [20240702-design_routine_as_research_question](<../memos/20240702-design_routine_as_research_question.md>)
- [20240702-design_material_format_and_design_attention](<../memos/20240702-design_material_format_and_design_attention.md>)

## Codebook

(All are new).

- **Structural**
	- Work sessions (1-4)
	- Playable prototype v1 (start-end)
	- Git fixing. These can be mostly ignored in terms of material changes, but always need to be contextualized.
- **Process**
	- Journaling
	- Paper prototyping
	- Preparing digital project
	- Designing visuals
	- Programming game logic
	- Fixing gameplay issues
	- Playtesting
	- Relating work
- **In vivo.** These do not use snake case.
	- go through prototype
	- bon apetit
	- dont do that
	- after all is the main goal here

## Next steps

- [ ] Memo `playtest_0` image.
- [ ] Memo `layoutSketching` image.
- [ ] Check first and last commits of project (?).
- [ ] Read last version of the `journal.md` file.
- [ ] Prepare for the 2nd pass.
