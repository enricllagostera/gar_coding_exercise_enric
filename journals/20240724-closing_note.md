# 2024-07-24 Closing note

This was interesting. The scope of the exercise made it difficult to answer the research question we chose. In a sense, it encompasses one big step in this design process, with smaller tasks described in a very atomic way, hard to break down into smaller steps from the documentation or materials themselves. However, I could identify some potential directions for further elaboration that connect to the matter of design routines.

The topic of #funny_fixes and [how commit messages use humor](<../memos/20240703-funny_fixes_humor_commit_msgs.md>) seems a relevant topic, in how it might tie together characteristics of the design process (openness, exploration) with emotional states (confidence, drawing from previous experience).

There is also matters of how different processes use different formats, as shown in how ideation and collaboration activities happened around sketches and paper prototypes. These appear as more atomic then they potentially are in the documentation, and I think this gets reflected in the coding. I am curious to see how the other participants went about approaching this. 

Even a base digital prototype involved referring to and switching back to a variety of previous steps, as well as plenty of preparation and planning for future actions. I am uncertain it shows a strong sense of routine itself, but using the process codes as a basis for finding patterns could be a good idea on the coding of a full project. The slice we are working on ends up encompassing a switch of formats (from paper to digital prototype) that is all within a larger step of "preparation" in connection to the main stated design goals of M. 

In terms of the coding activity itself, I think that keeping the journaling as I went was really good for identifying and branching out into memo-ing, as well as retrieving the threads when I came back to the activity in different days. It definitely felt like a more coherent and reflective process. I think the issue of identifying when code saturation happens is important: I have the impression that this happened in the exercise, but I feel I need to triangulate this. This certainly made it harder to do more involved 2nd cycle coding.

On a technical basis, the tool worked well, in spite of the issue with repeating codes which I need to fix. I plan to work on merging them automatically in the next version of the tool, to avoid making the resulting codebook and annotations too hard to read. Overall, the process was productive and I felt I gained insight and elaborated new angles towards the research question and understanding the process itself. Annotating codes in the tool felt quite intuitive and helpful, but a bit hard to read, due to the repeated codes bug.

I think the process-oriented coding I did might have been too descriptive. At the same time, I'm not sure there were enough salient features to do a mote emotions or value-oriented coding. Maybe other participants might have figured this out better?
