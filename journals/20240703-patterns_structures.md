# 2024-07-03 Some patterns and structural coding

Start: 11:34. Today I'll continue the coding first pass. I want to flesh out the process and in vivo coding a bit more. Also, to elaborate on the images.

Re-reading codes, it got me thinking of the relation between commits and days of work. Is there a significance in design work structure when there are multiple commits on a work day or when it is a single commit per workday? What is the usual structure in this repo or across a designers' works? I'm thinking of adding a structural code (`one_commit_a_day`) to mark this kind of difference. This might make it easier to notice differences between sequences of such commits and work that is more sporadic or more intense.

I think I'll add a first *pattern code* for the [funny fixes](<../memos/20240703-funny_fixes_humor_commit_msgs.md>) dynamic ( #funny_fixes ). More possibilities are discussed in [in a tentative axis around expectations in design moves](<../memos/20240703-potential_axis_expectations_humor.md>).

## Memo-ing images

This approach of creating a memo to describe and later add codes to visual info is meant to to help describe and account for the richness of visual data [@saldana2009a, 42]. (...) I didn't get enough time to do it, so tabling it.

## Next steps

- [ ] Memo `playtest_0` image.
- [ ] Memo `layoutSketching` image.
- [ ] Check first and last commits of project (?).
- [ ] Read last version of the `journal.md` file.
- [x] Prepare for the 2nd pass.
