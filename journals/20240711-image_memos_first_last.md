# 2024-07-11 Image memos and checking first / last

Start: 14:30.

I'll begin this session by memo-ing the images from the playtest. (...) OK, that went a bit faster than I expected, but it did give me some more process codes and activities to consider. It also might help to think about the connection of designer confidence and messages. I'm moving on to reading the journal entries and general project materials on the first and last commits. 

The first commit has an empty Unity project, so I marked it as `preparing_digital_project`. It also has an early journal entry that outlines the design definition and concept created before the repo creation. There is an image of an earlier brainstorming session (`ideating`), which I'd need to memo in more details later on. It also already states the dual goals of exploring procedural sound and of supporting analog game design communication.

The last commit does not have a journal entry and consists mostly of audio configuration files related to FMOD. It does not have a new build for testing, so understanding the impact of these files would need a more detailed exploration. On a first look it adds little context, except that it shows that later work might be more focused on the procedural audio design goal.

Moving to the [last version of the journal](https://github.com/mouseandthebillionaire/purrrfectPizza/blob/2ae02201421ab1fd79161f2baf9e9f86c94b145e/Process/README.md) . It seems there was a strong shift to audio-oriented activities after the focus period. There are fewer mentions generally about the game rules or general design and much more specifically about the audio design and explorations. It contextualizes the activities in the previous period (including the focus period) as a form of a preparation?  

End: 16h.
