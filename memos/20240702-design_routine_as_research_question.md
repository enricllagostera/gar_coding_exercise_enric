# On design routine as research question

2024-07-02

When I start considering this starter question, things that jump to me are sequences of actions, repetition, and a sense of what forms of preparation, or build-up and teardown can we see in design? 

Another aspect would be to somewhat bring my designer hat into the conversation and notice the differences between what I see as my own routines, as a way to notice features that are maybe specific to this person (Matt) or my own.

I also think that potentially the small slice might make it difficult to find a tentative answer to this question. Maybe at a decision by decision basis, but it might be hard to figure out connections between these micro decisions and a routine as part of broader expertise or style.
