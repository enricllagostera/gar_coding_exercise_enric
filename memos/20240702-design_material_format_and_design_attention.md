# Design material format and design attention

2024-07-02

My initial reading of the **work session 1** commit made me think that contrasting what is in digital and non-digital traces (e.g. design sketches and reflective journaling), or notes that refer to similar topics in different formats might be a productive angle here. How do routines intersect with design material formats? (...) Found a similar thing in how commit#7d26ab0 has a commit message that centers a technical process (i.e., deploying a build) while the journal mentions only visual design.
