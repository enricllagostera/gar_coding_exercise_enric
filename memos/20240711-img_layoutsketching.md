# 2024-07-11 Image memo for layoutSketching

The image features a combination of layout sketches that detail the general organization of game elements and descriptions of rules and items. Most text focuses on the connections and interrelations of the different game elements, and how they get activated in the piece behaviors. I am thinking of adding a process-code for this image as #defining_game_rules. There are also two mentions to other activities: 1) checking if *tiny islands* is open source #relating_work and 2) both wondering if the game tone / aspect is more "puzzle vs algorithmic" and if the items should be single or multiple-item cards ( #questioning_design_possibilities). 

I have the impression this shows a quite consolidated concept that has already matured from earlier iterations. There is a relative small number of open questions in comparison with how many things are getting affirmed here. This aligns with my impressions related to the [20240703-funny_fixes_humor_commit_msgs](<./20240703-funny_fixes_humor_commit_msgs.md>) matter of how consolidated and confident M sounds about the design and how that appears at the commit messages.
