# Potential axis: expectations and humor

2024-07-03

[Funny fixes](<./20240703-funny_fixes_humor_commit_msgs.md>) ( #funny_fixes ) might be able to be placed on continuum of *funny fixes* --> *tentative steps* -> *affirmative moves*? Tentative steps could be marked by questions in the commit messages, while affirmations are present when a process goes without major obstacles or as expected. I might expand on this as axial coding [@saldana2009a, 162].

This might connect with the different activities involved in these commits. Processes that are more open-ended or exploratory would fall more into the first two, while the latter is for perceptions of failure in actions with a more narrowly defined objective (e.g., preparing an online build, implementing a ruleset). Not sure about this, but could be something to look more into.

| Axis               | Expected success                     | Expected but challenging                                      | Unexpected or against expectations                       |

| Commit msg content | descriptive & affirmation            | descriptive & interrogation                                   | funny                                                    |
| Activities         | familiar, might be open-ended or not | open-ended or well-defined but unfamiliar (e.g. online build) | well-defined (e.g. online build, fixing gameplay issues) |
