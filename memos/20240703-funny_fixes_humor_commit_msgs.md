# Funny fixes and humor in commit messages

2024-07-03

I am starting to notice a certain connection between the tone and writing of the commit messages and what kind of activities there are in a commit, as in git fixing and dealing with deploying a build. Is there a connection between humor and "fixing" things? The hypothesis is that they appear together, maybe as motivation or as reward for dealing with the obstacles to design goals and moives that are the "issues" being fixed. When the actions happen more smoothly, the commit messages are more descriptive and serious in tone.

This also connects with other in vivo codes, like the #bon_apetit or #dont_do_that. I have added #funny_fixes as a code to mark this.
