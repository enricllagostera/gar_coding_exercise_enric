# 2024-07-11 Image memo for playtest0

The image is mostly a static and unannotated photo documentation of an analog prototype playtest session with a peer (Matt Sisson, whose hand is on the frame, I believe). It shows an early materialization of the game rules (as a result of #defining_game_rules). It def connects directly to shapes and arrangements described in [20240711-img_layoutsketching](<./20240711-img_layoutsketching.md>).

I personally know that Danny, Sisson and Zayna used to meet to play and test games together at the different venues in Boulder. I wonder if that is the case here. I added the process-code #collaborating here.
